              There's a lot to do in space. I want to learn more about the
              greenhouse effect on Venus, about whether there was life on Mars,
              about the environment in which Earth and the Sun is immersed, the
              behavior of the Sun. The problem is not scientifically illiterate
              kids; it is scientifically illiterate adults. Kids are born
              curious about the natural world. They are always turning over
              rocks, jumping with two feet into mud puddles and playing with the
              tablecloth and fine china. I don't care what town you're born in,
              what city, what country. If you're a child, you are curious about
              your environment. You're overturning rocks. You're plucking leaves
              off of trees and petals off of flowers, looking inside, and you're
              doing things that create disorder in the lives of the adults
              around you. There is always a place I can take someone's curiosity
              and land where they end up enlightened when we're done.

              I claim that space is part of our culture. You've heard complaints
              that nobody knows the names of the astronauts, that nobody gets
              excited about launches, that nobody cares anymore except people in
              the industry. I don't believe that for a minute. What you need,
              above all else, is a love for your subject, whatever it is. You've
              got to be so deeply in love with your subject that when curve
              balls are thrown, when hurdles are put in place, you've got the
              energy to overcome them. Although I'm not actually embarrassed by
              this, I tend not to read books that have awesome movies made from
              them, regardless of how well or badly the movie represented the
              actual written story. For most of human civilization, the pace of
              innovation has been so slow that a generation might pass before a
              discovery would influence your life, culture or the conduct of
              nations.

              We account for one-sixth of the forces of gravity we see in the
              universe. There is no known objects accounting for most of the
              effective gravity in the universe. Something is making stuff move
              that is not anything we have ever touched. Our galaxy, the Milky
              Way, is one of 50 or 100 billion other galaxies in the universe.
              And with every step, every window that modern astrophysics has
              opened to our mind, the person who wants to feel like they're the
              center of everything ends up shrinking. If you think of feelings
              you have when you are awed by something - for example, knowing
              that elements in your body trace to exploded stars - I call that a
              spiritual reaction, speaking of awe and majesty, where words fail
              you. In the animal kingdom, one of the keys to survival is to
              outwit your enemies. And when you're surrounded by carnivores, one
              of the best strategies is to fade into the background and
              disappear.

              Let me tell you something about full moons: kids don't care about
              full moons. They'll play in a full moon, no worries at all. They
              only get scared of magic or werewolves from stupid adults and
              their stupid adult stories. Asteroids have us in our sight. The
              dinosaurs didn't have a space program, so they're not here to talk
              about this problem. We are, and we have the power to do something
              about it. I don't want to be the embarrassment of the galaxy, to
              have had the power to deflect an asteroid, and then not, and end
              up going extinct. When an industry matures, it means it's not
              advancing, and of course the jobs go overseas. That's the
              obligation of the multi-national corporation: to put the factory
              where it can make the widget as cheap as possible. Don't get angry
              when a corporation does that; we've all bought into this concept.
              We live in a capitalistic society. I always try to get people a
              different outlook. When you do that, people take ownership of the
              information. They don't ever have to reference me because, I'd
              like to believe as an educator, I'm empowering them to have those
              thoughts themselves.

              framework by which we understand the diversity of life on Earth.
              But there is no equation sitting there in Darwin's 'Origin of
              Species' that you apply and say,
            </p>
            <p class="bg-black">Add <i>.indent</i></p>

              What is this species going to look like in 100 years or 1,000
              years?' Biology isn't there yet with that kind of predictive
              precision. You have people who believe they are scientifically
              literate but, in fact, are not. And I don't mind if you're not
              scientifically literate, but just admit that to yourself, so that
              you'll know, and perhaps you can take a first step to try to
              eradicate that. Kids should be allowed to break stuff more often.
              That's a consequence of exploration. Exploration is what you do
              when you don't know what you're doing. That's what scientists do
              every day. The universe is large and old, and the ingredients for
              life as we know it are everywhere, so there's no reason to think
              that Earth would be unique in that regard. Whether of not the life
              became intelligent is a different question, and we'll see if we
              find that.
